          Madison's Opinion
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Throughout the whole game, I got to see the absurdly wide
            range of interactions with these pick-up artists and the scary
            realities of hook-up culture.
          </li>
          <li> In each encounter with every
            pick-up artist, the conversation would start normally with small
            talk but slowly progressed to make me feel weirded
            me out and even often time be confused what the tactic was
            even being used to seduce me as the player.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specifically, whether it was a misogynistic comment, a threat
            made toward me, sexual advances done even after showing a lack of
            interet, rude and condescending remarks  about my appearance or
            age, or invasive questions about my personal life, the dialogue
            said by these men in these encounters would
            make me become quickly uncomfortable but also presented situations
            where I felt “trapped” and scared for my safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            I had even played with my rooomate and there would be times both
            of us would have to pause the game to process and react to
            certain actions that happened.
          </li>
          </li>
          <li>
            The thing that unsettled me the most was that the game wasn’t
            far from reality and often times I found the uncomfortable
            conversations I would have in the game to be some of which I
            could see myself having to have in real life. The pick-up artists
            would often make sexist remarks, use manipulation tactics,
            and try taking hold of the conversation to get their way, similar
            to possible real encounters women have to have with similar types
            of men in real life and even my own encounters with people like
            that.
          </li>
          <li>
            Especially as a woman, I felt as if my own fears and paranoia
            when it come to encounters with men like this have been heightened
            after this game and not even out of irrationality.
          </li>
          <li>
            After learning about how the pick-up artsists are like in real life
            and learning about the techniques they tend to use, I got to
            appreciate the level of insanely accurate detail the game was made with.
          </li>
          <li>
            The game overall truly opened my eyes to an entire community
            dedicated to techniques and actions as displayed in the game and
            the wide impact this community has had on others in the world.

          Elizabeth's
        </h2>
        <ul >
          <li>Upon cycling through the different pickup artists, I initially
            felt this really gross feeling as they forcefully attempted to
            get closer to you despite your rejections.
          </li>
          <li>
            However upon realization,
            I recognized that this “slimey” feeling of disgust had an element
            of familiarity to it. Like many girls my age, I’ve had unwanted
            advances from other men who completely disregarded my sense of
            boundaries and treated consent as a foreign concept.
          </li>
          <li>
            As I’m
            getting further and further along the game, being subjected
            to constant negging, insults, and degregation, I’m reminded of
            situations that have occurred in my own life.
          </li>
          <li>And yet, while I am lucky I havent encountered anyone as bold or
            forward as the pick up artists in the game, Wasko does a phenomenal
            job at encapsulating that same suffocating, and fearful feeling
            stemming from the experiences I mentioned earlier, one many women
            can recognize as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Its scary seeing how blatantly disrespectful
            the pick up artists are, how disgusting and potentially dangerous
            they can be as well. Yet the scariest part is in the realization
            that it isnt an exaggeration in the slightest.
          </li>
          <li>
            These characters are
            based entirely on real men who believe women are simply another
            notch in their belts after sleeping with them. Even worse, the
            hoards of other men that follow their teachings and practice it
            like a religion within their pick up artist community.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overall, I am both impressed, and shocked at how well researched
            and developed “The Game: The Game” is. Its both creepy, and
            educational as it gives you a first hand experience into the world
            of some of the women unfortunate enough to be on the receiving
            end of one of these pick up artists.
