    Angela Wasko is currently an associate professor of Art at Caregie Mellon University, and a politically engaged feminist media artist who through her work,spans across different forms of performance art, video art, and video games.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her project “The Game:The Game” was in development for four and a half years as Wasko dedicated time to researching the pick up artist community and even went as far as to interview said polarizing figures who were featured in her game in order to craft a narrative that can truly immerse the player into it.
</p>
<p>
    Waskos other works carry a similar theme of exploring sexuality and femininity and more importantly, our societies reactions towards them.
