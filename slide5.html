    Various pick up artist coaches offer books, DVD sets, and online video tutorials that share their strategies and teach other men how to seduce women. Some even go as far as to have in-person conferences in which the pick up coach meets with his followers in order to host live classes and exchange experiences/strategies with one another.The price of these materials can vary greatly depending on the coach. Most notably, with pick up artists such as Neil Strauss charging up to 4,000$  for a video coaching program.
