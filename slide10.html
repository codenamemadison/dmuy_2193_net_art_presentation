      Overall, I thought “The Game: The Game” was very well-made and
      well-researched in terms of its attention to detail, how entertaining
      it was, and how eerily realistic it was to real life. The game and
      researching about it after gave me a good understanding of the ways
      pick-up culture and the seduction community worked and exposed me to the
      scary reality of communities like this out there that rely on
      psychological manipulation and mental tactics to leave women to be more
      vulnerable. The game
      speaks volumes

  “The Game:The Game: does an excellent job at giving a player an introduction
  into the warped world of the pick up artist community. Not only that, but it
  serves as a genuinely enjoyable experience as its visuals, variation in
  choice, and extensive storyline blend together seamlessly into creating an
  eerie atmosphere that gives the player a glimpse into the misogynist culture
  that suffocates many women. However, the real horror is in the realization
  that everything we experience in the game is based entirely on real,
  prominent figures within the pick up community and their hoards of loyal
  supporters. That is the true spine chilling revelation as you begin to
  look deeper and see the painstaking effort put in by Washko to create
  an accurate, and realistic depiction of the men who subject women to
  this same treatment.
